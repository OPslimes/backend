# backend

## Getting started
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

for better visualization of the users structure and other stuff i recommend downloading [mongodb compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass), after installing it, use the mongodb uri on .env file to make a connection. the users are on "test2" database.
